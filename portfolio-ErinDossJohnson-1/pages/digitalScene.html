  <h4>Digital Scene!</h4>
  <p1>The first problem I had was with the colors. It was hard to come up with the colors on my own, so I looked up basic colors and then tweaked them to make them blend together better. I also havenâ€™t coded in awhile so my second problem was remembering how to use certain functions, like rect(); and remember what the variables stood for. I played around with them and figured them out on my own.</p1>

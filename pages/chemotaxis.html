  <h4>Chemotaxis!</h4>
  <p>Move your mouse and watch the cells follow!</p>
  <p1>This project I focused more on abstraction and trying to make my code more simple. I would say the hardest part of the project was figuring out how to organize it, since the other projects we had an outline that gave us an idea of where to put certain code. I had to check a couple of my past projects to really figure out how to organize the code, but for the most part I was able to do it on my own!</p1>

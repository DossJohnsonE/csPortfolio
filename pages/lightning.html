  <p1>This project was very fun to make! There was a lot of trial and error, but once a few tweaks were made, this worked great! One problem I had with this project was trying to get the line to go as one line. This was due to the random walk method I used. In order to fix this, I ended up making each line a bunch of small segments pieced together. To do this, I used a placeholder for the last x and y value used for each segment, so I could connect it to the next segment.</p1>
